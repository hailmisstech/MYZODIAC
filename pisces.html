<br>
<p>Compassionate, artistic, deeply emotional, especially empathic, at least a little bit psychic, and often inclined to throw themselves into caring for others at all costs, the Pisces in your life are some of the most magical people you'll ever come in contact with.
</p> Your lucky colour is yellow!
