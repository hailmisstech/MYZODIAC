  Sagittarians are lively, passionate, smart and more philosophical than their clown-y energy may hint at. They love to feel free and resist rules, regulations, constraints and schedules. They just like doing what they do, when they wanna do it. They're born travellers, adventurers, explorers and free spirits.
